# User Story

AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

# Actual Behavior

Semantic HTML elements throughout the index point to very specific CSS styling.
All elements follow a logical structure.
All images have been given appropriate and accurate alt elements.
All heading attributes fall in sequential order.
The title element is concise and descriptive.
